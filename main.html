Time Complexity & Space Complexity
Time complexity describes how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases, typically using Big O notation to represent the worst-case scenario. 
</p>
	<p>Space Complexity, O(n) Space complexity in computer science refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses, expressed in terms of the size of the input, and is often analyzed using Big O notation. </p>
